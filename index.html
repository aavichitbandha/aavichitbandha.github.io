<p style="color:#993366"><b>About</b></p>

<div>
    I mostly grew up in Lexington, KY and completed my B.S. at the University of Kentucky in May 2020, studying primarily pure mathematics (major) and computer science (minor).
    There, I was involved in the undergrad math lab and have projects linked below. 
    </br>
    In addition, I participated in James Madison University's math REU in 2019, additional info also linked below. 
</div> 

<div>
    I recieved a M.S. in Mathematics at NC State University in Aug 2022.
</div>

<div>
    In 2022 to 2024, I worked at Applied Research Associates on software development and computer vision research. 
    <!--My group is focused on using ML methods to develop geolocation capabilities for large volumes of photos.
    -->
</div>

<div>
    I resumed my studies in mathematics at the Universty of Nebraska, Lincoln, in Fall 2024.
</div>
    

<p style="color:#993366"><b>Teaching</b></p>

<div> 
    I worked as an undergraduate assistant at UKY from fall 2017 to spring 2020, tutoring in MathSkeller and assisting in a variety of classes through that time.
    In fall 2018 and spring 2019, I was an UA for MA 141 Calculus I MathExcel recitations and in spring 2020, I was the UA and grader for MA 433 Complex Analysis. 
</div>

 <div>
    At NC State, I was a TA for:
    </br>
    MA 111 Precalculus Algebra and Trigonometry - Fall 2020 </br>
    MA 141 Calculus I - Spring 2021, Spring 2022 </br>
    MA 225 Foundations of Advanced Mathematics - Summer 2021 </br>
    MA 242 Calculus III - Fall 2021 </br>
</div>

<div>
    At UNL, I am currently a TA for MA 106 Calculus I.
</div>


<p style="color:#993366"><b>Research</b></p>

<div> 
    During summer 2019, my REU group studied abelian sandpiles/critical groups on strongly regular graphs. 
    Further information can be found <a href="http://educ.jmu.edu/~duceyje/undergrad/2019/index.html">here</a>.
    </br>
    Our work contributed to a paper which can be accessed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07686v1">here on ArXiv</a>. 
</div>

<div> 
    I was part of two research projects in the University of Kentucky Undergraduate Math Lab.
    </br>
    From summer to fall 2018, I worked on <a href="https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/2018/10/computations-in-tropical-geometry.html">computations in tropical geometry</a> where we studied "well-poised" hypersurfaces.
    This is a very nice class of hypersurfaces (originally defined by Ilten and Manon in 2017 for ideals more generally) and I was primarily involved with establishing an equivalent definition based on the polynomials' support and characterizing their tropical varieties.
    </br> 
    Our resulting publication is accessible <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00060">here on ArXiv</a>.
    </br>
    </br>
    From spring 2019 to spring 2020, I was part of a group that conducted <a href="https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/2019/08/experiments-with-geomertry-and-algebra.html">experiements with geometry and algebra in the Heisenberg group</a>. 
    We investigated the asymptotic growth of geometric objects generated by the discrete Heisenberg group's operation, which is non-commutative.
    Ehrhart Theory addresses such behavior when the operation is commutative so we tried to find analogs for those well-established methods, in addition to applying computational methods to get a better idea of these curious objects.

<p style="color:#993366"><b>Mathematical Quilts</b></p>

<div> 
    Another project I was involved in at the UK undergrad math lab was creation of mathematical quilts. We designed these quilts to be visually interesting and garner attention, including from those not necessarily too interested in math. Some of them have also been displayed at the art gallery at the Joint Math Meetings!

    In addition, if you're interested in creating math quilts with a group too, there is a <a href="https://ukmathlab.blogspot.com/p/how-we-make-quilts.html">tutorial</a> on the website.
